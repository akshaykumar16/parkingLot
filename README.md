# parkingLot

Created the parking lot with the following features

We can create parking floor dynamically with the 10 slots initally. In which 10 slots are divide into 5 different parking spot types { HANDICAPPED("Handicapped"), COMPACT("Compact"), LARGE("Large"),MOTORBIKE("MotorBike"), ELECTRIC("Electric");}

We can also expose where we can add parking spot at the particular floor

While we are parking the car the ticket number is generated automatically to park the car the customer has to enter car number and car color. (The unqiueness of a car is defined as combination of carnumber and car color (Its just my assumption))

While we are unparking the car the customer must enter the car number and car color;

Get the status of the parked cars.

Get all the cars registration numbers based on the color of the car

Get all the vehicle locations based on the color of the car

Get the slot number based on color and car number.
