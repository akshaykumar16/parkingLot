Created the parking lot with the following features


1. We can create parking floor dynamically with the 10 slots initally. 
    In which 10 slots are divide into 5 different parking spot types {  HANDICAPPED("Handicapped"), COMPACT("Compact"), LARGE("Large"),MOTORBIKE("MotorBike"), ELECTRIC("Electric");}


2. We can also expose where we can add parking spot at the particular floor

3. While we are parking the car the ticket number is generated automatically to park the car the customer has to enter car number and car color. (The unqiueness of a car is defined as combination of carnumber 
and car color (Its just my assumption))

5. Get the status of the parked cars.

6. Get all the cars registration numbers based on the color of the car

7. Get all the vehicle locations based on the color of the car
